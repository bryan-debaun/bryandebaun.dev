# CPTSD — Thoughts & Reflections

## TL;DR

This is my experience with Complex PTSD—what I've learned so far, what's helped, what I'm still figuring out. I spent nearly fifteen years treating symptoms without understanding their source. Getting the right diagnosis ten months ago changed everything. This post is part processing, part resource-sharing for anyone on a similar path.

## Context

I was accurately diagnosed with CPTSD about ten months ago. Before that, I'd spent roughly fifteen years treating depression and anxiety—addressing symptoms without understanding the underlying trauma that shaped them. The diagnosis wasn't just a label; it reframed my entire experience and opened up treatment approaches that actually worked.

The last year has been difficult, but it's also been the most productive therapeutic work I've done. Understanding CPTSD allowed me to adapt my treatments more specifically and re-contextualize patterns I'd been living with for years. This post exists to externalize some of that work and offer what resources and observations might be useful to others navigating similar terrain.

This is written for a public audience, but it's deeply personal. I'm sharing what feels relevant without exposing details that belong to other people or that don't serve the larger point. If you're struggling with similar issues, I hope some of this resonates or points you toward something helpful.

## Personal Observations

### Relational

**Trust patterns:**
I established a pattern early of trusting too quickly—likely shaped by my parents' divorce and the significant age gap with my siblings (15 and 18 years). Without stable, consistent relationships during formative years, I learned to attach fast and hold on tight. The underlying foundation was an overwhelming fear that everyone would eventually abandon me, or that I was fundamentally unworthy of love.

This showed up as investing deeply in relationships that hadn't been tested, which meant getting burned repeatedly. I'm learning now to let relationships prove themselves before offering full trust—not out of cynicism, but out of self-preservation and discernment.

I also treated relationships as all-or-nothing for a long time. Someone was either safe or dangerous, worthy of trust or not. I'm still working on holding the nuance that people can be trustworthy in some contexts and not others, that imperfection doesn't equal abandonment.

**Progress:**
I'm getting much better at noticing my instinctive self-guilt and perfectionism when they show up in relationships. I used to rigorously analyze every thought and emotion before expressing it—needing to be rational, defensible, correct. Now I'm learning to just explore how things feel, to let others reflect back to me without having to have it all figured out first.

My boundaries have improved significantly. Part of my journey has been flipping the script: instead of being so readily available and constantly seeking to give, I'm letting others give if they're worth it. I'm learning to identify people who won't take advantage of me, rather than assuming I need to earn my place by being useful.

I'm always open to repairing relationships, but I'm more mature now about forcing things when the other person isn't as emotionally intelligent or willing to do the work. Repair requires two people.

Vulnerability used to feel dangerous. Now, with people I fully trust, it feels incredibly rewarding.

### Professional

**Decision-making under pressure:**
Under pressure, I tend to be incredibly deferring—avoiding conflict when possible, which lines up directly with my trauma response. My perfectionism was present but inconsistent: I could obsess over details in some contexts, then completely disengage if I felt my effort wasn't tied to meaningful impact.

I was often too quick to delegate or too afraid to take ownership of items. Looking back, this was about avoiding responsibility that could lead to criticism or failure. When criticism did come, I took it too much to heart, let it define me rather than just inform my work.

**Communication dynamics:**
I ruminate constantly. I'd find myself replaying work interactions or second-guessing technical approaches well beyond working hours—most of which were probably mundane in the end. I read too much into some things (tone in Slack messages, a manager's offhand comment) while simultaneously not reading into other things enough (actual warning signs, patterns that mattered).

I always yearned for critiques, but I think that was a defense mechanism. If my inner critic is loud enough, I might be too quick to accept that something is my fault. Conflict-avoidant throughout. I may have been guilty of over-explaining depending on context, though I'm not sure I over-justified—the line between helpful context and defensive explanation is blurry for me.

**Progress:**
I'm comfortable asking questions now without the same level of shame. I can set professional boundaries more clearly than I used to. But I'm still on a journey here—I need to get over feeling fundamentally incompetent and learn to silence (or at least turn down) my inner critic.

Part of my path forward involves looking for more purposeful work and adapting the strides I've made in identifying personal triggers to professional contexts. Recognizing when I'm in a triggered state versus responding to actual workplace dynamics is still a work in progress.

### Internal/Emotional

**Emotional regulation:**
In DBT terms, I've over-developed and relied heavily on my logical brain. I can dissociate easily, and while that's been a useful survival tool in the past, it comes with trade-offs. The strength is the ability to contain harmful interactions and thoughts, then process them productively later. The weakness is appearing emotionally flat or robotic, disconnected from what I'm actually feeling in the moment.

I've detached significantly from my physical feelings—my felt-self—and reconnecting with that has been a major focus of treatment. I know I can get triggered, and I've made significant progress in identifying when it's happening, but I haven't fully figured out the regulation part yet. Learning to be present through mindfulness, meditation, breathing exercises, exploring nature and music—these have all been essential.

I have a lot of thoughts, a lot of the time. Intrusive thoughts are constant. Meditation, music, and structure have been useful tools for managing the noise.

**Self-perception:**
Before diagnosis, I assumed I was just depressed and anxious—that something or someone could eventually pull me out of it. I looked to romantic partners to externalize validation, which wasn't fair to them and didn't address the actual trauma underneath.

Now I'm working on taking time for myself, exploring the things that matter to me and that I care about. But I can still spiral quickly—a combination of my inner critic, relative intelligence, and tendency to internalize everything. I've made strides in identifying when it's happening, but I'm still working on improving my responses.

A major breakthrough has been identifying a small "inner-parent" voice. It's quiet, but it's there, and I've been focused on cultivating it. The pattern I fall into is having a very strict and critical image of myself. If others reflect something to me that doesn't align with that image, I shrug it off as inaccurate. But if their feedback comports with my self-critique, it kicks off a cascade of thoughts about how to fix it. I'm trying to find middle ground there and incorporate feelings more instead of just analysis.

My sense of self feels small. That's something I'm actively trying to take ownership of and build.

**Re-contextualization:**
A recent example with my current partner: she's on vacation and mentioned plans to go line-dancing. My immediate response was playful but dismissive—"gross" (I don't like country music, she does). She responded equally playfully: "what I'm hearing is I'm happy that my girlfriend is getting to do something she enjoys."

That sparked a meta-conversation where I could reflect: yes, if my first instinct is to respond with disdain—even jokingly—it can become grating over time. Maybe I should lead with affirmation and then engage in the ribbing. It's a small example, but it illustrates the larger pattern: my default response often bypasses connection in favor of cleverness or critique.

The relationship feels safe and secure, which has allowed me to notice these patterns without immediately spiraling into shame about them.

**Progress:**
I'm getting better at noticing triggers without being entirely consumed by them. The inner-parent voice is growing, even if it's still small. I can identify when I'm dissociating or when I'm in my head instead of present. Self-compassion is still difficult, but it's not completely absent anymore.

I'm learning that healing isn't about eliminating the logical brain or the survival mechanisms that got me here—it's about integrating them with the parts I've had to shut down.

### Physical

**Somatic symptoms:**
One major pattern that's emerged in therapy is how much stress I carry in my hands. I grip reflexively when stressed, pull my hands closer to my body, or gesticulate intensely. A lot of my work now is trying to be more open to sensations and curious without judgment about what my hands are doing. Still very much a work in progress.

The hands thing makes sense when I trace it back: I rowed in college (very hand-focused, lots of muscle memory and instinct built there), played trumpet through high school (the valve buttons are still instinctual in my right hand), and I'm a software engineer (typing constantly). These activities are emblematic of my coping mechanisms: music, sports, coding. All hand-intensive, all ways of managing or escaping what I was feeling.

I've been trying to learn saxophone and piano recently, which has been difficult in an interesting way. I rowed as a sweeper on the port side, so my left hand was responsible for strength while my right hand developed dexterity. But music and typing require both hands to be dextrous, which means retraining patterns that are decades old.

Sleep has been an ongoing struggle. My dad has sleep issues too—there's likely something hereditary there—and I'm still exploring how to resolve it. I'm NOT a morning person, and I find myself easily fatigued by the end of each week and most mornings regardless of rest.

The only chronic physical issue that's shown up consistently is sciatica.

**What's helped:**
Yoga and breathing exercises have been surprisingly effective—particularly Wim Hof's breathing techniques. The body-based work complements talk therapy in ways I didn't expect. Talk therapy helps me understand the patterns cognitively; body work helps me actually feel and release what's stored there.

A lot of this work over the last year has been at the guidance of my therapist, who's been instrumental in helping me reconnect with my body.

**Progress:**
Most of the progress has been centered around body awareness. I'm better at noticing when I'm gripping, when tension is building, when I'm disconnecting from physical sensation. I don't always know what to do with that awareness yet, but recognizing it is the first step.

I'm learning that my body has been keeping score this whole time, and I'm finally starting to listen.

## Questions

These are living questions—some clinical, some experiential, some philosophical. I'm exploring all of them.

### Clinical:

- How do different trauma therapies compare for developmental trauma vs. single-incident PTSD? What makes EMDR effective where talk therapy struggled?
- What does the research say about hereditary components of sleep disorders, and how do they interact with trauma-related sleep disruption?
- Is there a neurological basis for why body-based trauma work (somatic therapy, yoga, breathwork) complements cognitive approaches?

### Experiential:

- How do others navigate the tension between wanting deep connection and needing significant alone time to regulate?
- What strategies help when you can identify you're triggered but haven't yet developed effective regulation responses?
- How do people maintain professional boundaries and career momentum while doing intensive trauma work that requires so much energy?

### Philosophical:

- What does "healing" actually mean when trauma is woven into your development? Is it integration, symptom reduction, or something else entirely?
- How do you build a coherent sense of self when so much of your identity was shaped by survival mechanisms that are no longer serving you?
- Is there value in keeping some dissociative capacity as a tool, or does healing require fully letting go of all protective mechanisms?

### Research to pursue:

- Papers on CPTSD and attachment styles formed in childhood (particularly related to parental divorce and age gaps with siblings)
- Studies on the inner critic and its role in perfectionism and self-abandonment
- Literature on somatic markers of trauma and hand/grip tension patterns

### Experiments to try:

- Structured sleep hygiene protocols specifically for trauma-related sleep disruption
- Different approaches to cultivating the "inner parent" voice (IFS therapy, reparenting exercises, compassion-focused therapy)
- Ways to practice affirmation-first communication patterns in safe relationships

### Therapy & Treatment Approaches

**EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):**
Francine Shapiro's *Getting Past Your Past* is the foundational text. EMDR has been one of the most effective modalities for me—it works differently than talk therapy and gets at material that's hard to access through conversation alone.

**Gottman Method:**
[Gottman Institute](https://www.gottman.com/) — particularly valuable for understanding relational patterns and repair. Their research-based approach to communication and conflict has been clarifying.

### Books

**Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving** by Pete Walker
This book has been both invaluable and difficult to confront. Walker writes from lived experience and clinical expertise. His work on emotional flashbacks and the "4Fs" (fight, flight, freeze, fawn) gave me language for things I'd been experiencing but couldn't name.

**The Body Keeps the Score** by Bessel van der Kolk
Essential reading on how trauma lives in the body. Dense but worth it. Van der Kolk's research on somatic therapies and the neuroscience of trauma helped me understand why body-based work matters.

**Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life** by Steven C. Hayes
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) framework. Useful for sitting with discomfort rather than constantly trying to fix or avoid it.

**When Panic Attacks** by David Burns
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques. Particularly helpful for the anxiety piece before I had the full CPTSD diagnosis.

### Additional Resources

**Pete Walker's website:** [pete-walker.com](https://pete-walker.com/index.htm)
Free articles on emotional flashbacks, toxic shame, and the 4Fs. His writing is direct and practical.

**Wim Hof Method:**
Breathing exercises that have genuinely helped with regulation. The science is still being debated, but the technique itself has been useful for me.
